# MoodleCourseGeneration
This is a simple web application created for professors at the University of Delaware using
Moodle to administer exams to their students.

Following the main goals of our CISC475 Spring 2020 semester project, we aim for this application to make the process of creating docker containers, downloading exam data, and killing docker containers as simple as possible.
